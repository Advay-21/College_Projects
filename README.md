**Smart Shopping Cart**

The Smart Shopping Cart project is an advanced retail automation solution that integrates computer vision, IoT, and real-time data processing to revolutionize the in-store shopping experience. The system uses a YOLOv5-based object detection model, trained on a custom dataset, to visually recognize products as they are placed in the cart, while weight sensors (load cells connected to an ESP32 microcontroller) provide a secondary layer of verification for both item addition and removal. This dual-modality approach ensures high accuracy in product identification and billing, addressing key limitations of traditional barcode/RFID and vision-only systems. The cart features a user-friendly mobile application (built with React Native) for real-time billing, product details, and seamless payment integration via RazorPay. Backend cloud integration with Firebase enables real-time inventory updates and transaction management. The system was rigorously tested, achieving over 90% mAP in object detection and weight verification within a 5-gram error margin, and demonstrated robust performance in diverse, real-world retail scenarios. Future enhancements include edge AI deployment, expanded product coverage, and advanced security protocols, positioning the solution for scalable commercial adoption.

**Dynamic Object Tracking**

This project implements a real-time dynamic object tracking system in video streams, leveraging the YOLOv5 algorithm for high-accuracy object detection and Kalman Filters for robust multi-object tracking. The workflow processes each video frame to detect multiple object categories (such as pedestrians, vehicles, and bicycles), then applies motion analysis to track their trajectories across frames. The system visualizes bounding boxes and movement paths, providing clear insights into object dynamics. Emphasis was placed on real-time performance, achieving high frame rates (over 350 FPS on suitable hardware) and reliable detection even in complex or crowded scenes. The solution is scalable, adaptable to additional object classes, and suitable for applications ranging from surveillance to autonomous navigation. Limitations include sensitivity to hardware capabilities and challenging environments (e.g., low light), but the project demonstrates the effectiveness of combining deep learning detection with classical tracking for robust video analytics.

**Customer Segmentation and Analysis**

This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior and marketing campaign effectiveness using a retail dataset. Data preprocessing was performed in Python to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and ensure data integrity. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and advanced visualizations were created in Tableau, revealing key trends such as income distribution by education and marital status, recency of purchases, web purchase patterns, and customer response to marketing campaigns. The analysis segmented customers based on demographic and behavioral attributes, uncovering actionable insights—such as higher average income among PhD holders, spending patterns by education level, and the impact of recency on spending. Interactive dashboards and storytelling techniques were used to communicate findings, empowering strategic decision-making for targeted marketing and customer engagement.

**Diabetes Prediction**

This project focuses on building a robust machine learning pipeline to predict diabetes in patients using medical diagnostic data. The dataset, comprising features like pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and age, was thoroughly preprocessed to handle missing values and encode categorical variables. Multiple classification algorithms—including logistic regression, Naive Bayes, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and AdaBoost—were evaluated, with AdaBoost (using a decision tree base estimator) achieving the best accuracy and F1 score. The model’s performance was assessed using metrics such as ROC-AUC, confusion matrices, and learning/validation curves, achieving a ROC-AUC score of 0.744. Extensive exploratory data analysis provided clinical insights, such as the relationship between glucose levels, age, insulin, and diabetes outcomes. The project demonstrates the utility of ensemble learning in medical prediction and suggests future improvements through parameter tuning and expanded feature engineering.

**Graduate Analytics (Python Project)**
This exploratory data analysis project investigates the demographic, academic, and career attributes of engineering graduates using synthetic data. Implemented in Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project examines gender distribution, birth month patterns, academic performance (10th, 12th, and college GPA), salary outcomes, and geographic representation across states and degree levels. Key visualizations include bar graphs for gender and state-wise distribution, scatter plots for GPA vs. salary and academic performance correlations, and pie charts for degree-level placement percentages. The analysis reveals moderate correlations between academic achievement and salary, highlights demographic diversity, and provides actionable insights into graduate profiles and potential career trajectories. The project demonstrates proficiency in data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis, serving as a template for real-world graduate analytics.

**Resume Builder (Web Engineering)**
The Resume Builder project is a web-based application designed to streamline the creation of professional resumes through an interactive, user-friendly interface. Built as part of a web engineering curriculum, the application allows users to input personal, educational, and professional details, select from dynamic templates, and generate formatted resumes ready for download or printing. The system emphasizes modular code structure, responsive design, and a seamless user experience, making resume creation accessible to users with varying technical backgrounds. The project showcases skills in front-end development, form handling, and template rendering, and serves as a practical demonstration of web engineering principles applied to a real-world problem
